            <!--files and folders -->
            <h2 id="files">Files and Folders</h2> <br>
            When you first open vscode it should look something like this <br>

            <br>
            Navigate to the file icon on the left-hand side of your screen <br>

            <br>
            Click the "Open Folder" button and find the folder with the code you want to edit <br>

            <br>
            You can use this tab to navigate your files, and to create new files and folders. <br>

            <!--git-->
            <h2 id="git">Git</h2> <br>
            Along with managing your files, VSCode lets you manage git repos. If you don't already have your git repos
            up and running, go do that. This is a tutorial for vscode, not git! <br>
            <br>
            To get started, go to the left-hand menu and click the git icon. <br>
            <img src="https://i.imgur.com/NUVbd3a.png" alt="a red arrow pointing to the git icon in vscode"> <br>
            <br>
            If you don't already have a folder open you will be prompted with this screen <br>
            <img src="https://i.imgur.com/SIZfySn.png" alt="the git tab in vscode with no folder open"><br>
            <br>
            You can connect your git account to vscode and clone a repo that way. You can also clone a repo the normal
            way using terminal and just open the folder. <br>
            <br>
            If you open a folder that isn't a git repo you will be prompted with this<br>
            <img src="https://i.imgur.com/3w0BGwi.png" alt="vscode source control panel"> <br>
            <br>
            If your github account is connected to vscode you can create a repo and push it to your account. If you
            choose the "Initialize Repository" option, vscode will make a new repo, but that repo will only be on your
            computer, not on github.<br>
            <br>
            Once you have your git repo opened the source control panel should look like this <br>
            <img src="https://i.imgur.com/sJyOxth.png" alt="source control panel with no changes"> <br>
            <br>
            When you make a change it shows up in the source control panel <br>
            <img src="https://i.imgur.com/GYx9FVL.png" alt="The vscode source control panel with a change made"> <br>
            <br>
            If you want to see what was changed you can click on the changed document. It will look something like this:

            <br>
            To make a commit type your commit message into the entry box and press the check mark <br>

                alt="source control panel with an arrow pointing to the commit button"> <br>
            <br>
            To push your commits you can click the "Sync Changes" button <br>
